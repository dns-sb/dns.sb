# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is DNS?

DNS (Domain Name System) is often called the "phonebook of the Internet." It translates human-readable domain names like `example.com` into machine-readable IP addresses like `192.0.2.1`. Every time you visit a website, send an email, or use any online service, a DNS query happens behind the scenes to find the correct server address.

### What is DNS.SB?

DNS.SB is a free, privacy-focused public DNS resolver service operated by [xTom](https://xtom.com/). We provide fast, secure, and private DNS resolution with support for traditional DNS, DNS over TLS (DoT), and DNS over HTTPS (DoH). Our servers are deployed globally to ensure low latency and high availability.

### Why should I use DNS.SB instead of my ISP's DNS?

There are several compelling reasons:

- **Privacy**: Your ISP can see and log every website you visit. DNS.SB does not log any DNS queries.
- **Speed**: Our global anycast network ensures fast response times from anywhere in the world.
- **Security**: We support DNSSEC validation to protect against DNS spoofing attacks.
- **No censorship**: We do not block or filter any domains (except for legal requirements).
- **Encrypted DNS**: We support DoT and DoH to prevent eavesdropping on your DNS queries.

### Is DNS.SB free?

Yes, DNS.SB is completely free for personal and non-commercial use. There are no premium tiers, no ads, and no data collection.

### Who operates DNS.SB?

DNS.SB is operated by [xTom GmbH](https://xtom.com/), a global network and infrastructure company headquartered in Germany. xTom operates a massive anycast network across 30+ locations on 6 continents.

## Privacy & Security

### Does DNS.SB log my DNS queries?

No. We do not store any logs of DNS queries. We cannot see which websites you visit, and we have no data to share with anyone - including governments or law enforcement. You cannot share what you do not have.

### Does DNS.SB use EDNS Client Subnet (ECS)?

No. EDNS Client Subnet sends part of your IP address to authoritative DNS servers, which can compromise your privacy. DNS.SB is a privacy-centric resolver and does not send any client IP information to upstream servers.

### Does DNS.SB support DNSSEC?

Yes, DNS.SB is a DNSSEC-validating resolver. DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) provides authentication of DNS data, protecting you from cache poisoning and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### What is DNS Query Name Minimisation?

DNS Query Name Minimisation (RFC 7816) reduces the amount of information sent to authoritative DNS servers. Instead of sending the full domain name to every server in the resolution chain, we only send the minimum necessary information. This enhances your privacy by limiting data exposure.

### Does DNS.SB block any websites?

No, we do not implement any content filtering or blocking. DNS.SB provides neutral, unfiltered DNS resolution. We believe users should have full control over their internet experience.

## DNS over TLS (DoT)

### What is DNS over TLS?

DNS over TLS (DoT) encrypts DNS queries using the TLS protocol (the same encryption used for HTTPS websites). This prevents anyone on your network - including your ISP - from seeing or tampering with your DNS queries.

### How do I use DNS over TLS?

You need a DoT-compatible client or operating system. We provide setup guides for:

- [Android 9+](/dot/android/) (built-in Private DNS feature)
- [Linux](/dot/linux/) (using systemd-resolved)
- [Windows](/dot/windows/) (using YogaDNS or similar)

### What are the DoT server details?

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Hostname | `dot.sb` |
| Port | `853` |
| IPv4 | `185.222.222.222`, `45.11.45.11` |
| IPv6 | `2a09::`, `2a11::` |

## DNS over HTTPS (DoH)

### What is DNS over HTTPS?

DNS over HTTPS (DoH) encrypts DNS queries using the HTTPS protocol. Like DoT, it prevents eavesdropping on your DNS traffic. DoH has the additional benefit of being indistinguishable from regular web traffic, making it harder to block.

### How do I use DNS over HTTPS?

Most modern browsers support DoH natively. We provide setup guides for:

- [Mozilla Firefox](/doh/firefox/)
- [Google Chrome](/doh/chrome/)
- [Microsoft Edge](/doh/edge/)
- [Vivaldi](/doh/vivaldi/)
- [Windows 11](/doh/windows/)
- [Linux](/doh/linux/)

### What are the DoH server URLs?

**Global CDN (Recommended)**

```bash
https://doh.dns.sb/dns-query
```

Alternative URLs:
- `https://doh.sb/dns-query`
- `https://dns.sb/dns-query`

**Pure IP (for clients that don't support hostnames)**

- IPv4: `https://185.222.222.222/dns-query`
- IPv4: `https://45.11.45.11/dns-query`
- IPv6: `https://[2a09::]/dns-query`
- IPv6: `https://[2a11::]/dns-query`

### What's the difference between DoT and DoH?

| Feature | DNS over TLS (DoT) | DNS over HTTPS (DoH) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Port | 853 | 443 |
| Protocol | TLS | HTTPS |
| Visibility | Can be identified as DNS traffic | Looks like regular HTTPS traffic |
| Blocking | Easier to block | Harder to block |
| Use case | System-wide DNS | Browser or application-specific |

Both provide strong encryption and privacy. Choose based on your needs and what your device supports.

185.222.222.222
45.11.45.11
```

**IPv6**

```bash
2a09::
2a11::
```

Yes, we really have the shortest IPv6 addresses in the world!

If your device requires full IPv6 addresses:

```bash
2a09:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
2a11:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
```

### Does DNS.SB support IPv6?

## Technical Details

### Does DNS.SB support DNS64?

Currently, DNS.SB does not provide DNS64 service. We may add this feature in the future.

### What software does DNS.SB use?

We use industry-standard DNS resolver software with custom optimizations for performance and privacy. The specific software stack is not publicly disclosed for security reasons.

### Can I use DNS.SB as an upstream resolver for my own DNS server?

Yes, you can configure your local DNS server (such as Pi-hole, AdGuard Home, or Unbound) to use DNS.SB as an upstream resolver. We recommend using DoT or DoH for the upstream connection to maintain privacy.

### Does DNS.SB support DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ)?

DNS.SB currently supports **HTTP/3** for our DNS-over-HTTPS service, which uses QUIC as the transport layer. This provides many of the same benefits as DoQ, including faster connection establishment and improved performance.

**What's the difference between DoH with HTTP/3 and DoQ?**

| Feature | DoH with HTTP/3 | DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Protocol layers | HTTP/3 + QUIC | QUIC only (no HTTP) |
| Port | 443 | 853 |
| Overhead | HTTP headers included | Minimal, DNS directly over QUIC |
| Traffic visibility | Looks like regular HTTPS | Can be identified as DNS |
| Specification | RFC 8484 + RFC 9114 | RFC 9250 |

Both use QUIC transport and benefit from 0-RTT connection resumption, connection migration, and improved performance over lossy networks. DoH3 is better for privacy (blends with web traffic), while DoQ is more efficient (no HTTP overhead).

We are evaluating native DoQ support for the future.
