# Using DNS over TLS at DNS.SB

## What is DNS over TLS

DNS over TLS (DoT) is a security protocol for encrypting and authenticating communications between DNS clients and servers. The goal of the protocol is to provide privacy and integrity for DNS queries and responses, by encrypting the query and response payloads and by providing authentication of the DNS server's identity. DNS over TLS is designed to operate over port 853, which is separate from the traditional DNS port (53). This allows it to be easily deployed in parallel with an existing DNS infrastructure, while providing an additional layer of security.

## Our DoT Servers

*No Logging, DNSSEC enabled*

### Hostname for TLS Authentication

```bash filename="Terminal"
dot.sb
```

### TLS Port

- `853`

### IPv4

```bash filename="Terminal"
185.222.222.222
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
45.11.45.11
```

### IPv6

```bash filename="Terminal"
2a09::
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
2a11::
```

### IPv6 with Full Address

```bash filename="Terminal"
2a09:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
```

```bash filename="Terminal"
2a11:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
```
