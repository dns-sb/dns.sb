# How to set DNS over TLS on Windows

Windows does not have native DNS over TLS support. This guide uses YogaDNS as a third-party client.

### Install YogaDNS

Download and install the latest version from the [official website](https://yogadns.com/download/).

### Launch with Empty Configuration

After installation, launch YogaDNS. Start with an empty configuration:

- Under `DNS over TLS options`, set `Hostname` to `dot.sb`
