# Privacy Policy

At DNS.SB, we believe that **privacy is a fundamental human right**. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our website and DNS services.

**TL;DR: We don't collect or store your DNS queries. Period.**

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### DNS Services (DNS, DoT, DoH)

**We do not log DNS queries.** Specifically:

- We do not record which domains you query
- We do not record your IP address in connection with DNS queries
- We do not record timestamps of your queries
- We do not record any personally identifiable information (PII)

Our servers are configured with logging disabled. We cannot see what websites you visit, and we have no data to share with anyone.

### Technical Measures

To further protect your privacy, we implement:

- **DNS Query Name Minimisation** ([RFC 7816](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7816)): We only send the minimum necessary information to authoritative name servers.
- **No EDNS Client Subnet**: We do not send any portion of your IP address to upstream DNS servers.
- **Encrypted protocols**: We support DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH) to prevent eavesdropping.

### Website

Our website uses a **self-hosted instance** of Plausible Analytics, a privacy-focused, open-source analytics tool. Because we host it ourselves, your data never leaves our infrastructure - no third-party services are involved.

Plausible:

- Does not use cookies
- Does not collect personal data
- Does not track users across websites
- Is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR
- Collects only aggregate, anonymous statistics (page views, referrers, country)

We do not use any tracking scripts, advertising networks, or third-party analytics services.

---

## 2. Information We Share

**We share nothing because we collect nothing.**

We cannot share, sell, or disclose information that we do not have. Since we do not log DNS queries, there is no query data to share with anyone - including governments, law enforcement, or commercial entities.

---

## 3. When We May Block Access

We reserve the right to block IP addresses or ASNs to protect our service, including situations where:

- Our network is being abused (e.g., DDoS attacks originating through our service)
- There are violations of our [Terms of Service](/tos/)
- We need to protect the service quality for other users
- We are required to comply with applicable laws or regulations

Blocking is done at the network level and does not involve logging or storing your DNS queries.

---

## 4. Cookies

We do not use cookies on our website or in our DNS services.

---

## 5. Data Retention

Since we do not collect DNS query data, there is nothing to retain or delete.

For website analytics (Plausible), only aggregate statistics are stored. No individual user data is collected or retained.

---

## 6. Your Rights Under GDPR

As a service operated by xTom GmbH in Germany, we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You have the following rights:

- **Right of Access**: You may request access to any personal data we hold about you.
- **Right to Rectification**: You may request correction of inaccurate data.
- **Right to Erasure**: You may request deletion of your personal data.
- **Right to Restriction**: You may request restriction of processing.
- **Right to Data Portability**: You may request a copy of your data in a portable format.
- **Right to Object**: You may object to processing of your personal data.

However, since we do not collect or store personal data from our DNS services, most of these rights do not practically apply. If you believe we hold any personal data about you, please [contact us](/contact/).

### Legal Basis for Processing

For our website analytics, we rely on **legitimate interests** (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) to understand aggregate usage patterns and improve our service. This processing is minimal, anonymous, and does not impact your rights or freedoms.

---

## 7. International Data Transfers

Our DNS servers are located in multiple countries worldwide to provide low-latency service. When you use our DNS service, your query is processed by the nearest server. Since we do not log queries, no personal data is transferred or stored internationally.

---

## 8. Children's Privacy

Our services are not directed at children under 16. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make significant changes, we will post a notice on our website. Your continued use of our services after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
